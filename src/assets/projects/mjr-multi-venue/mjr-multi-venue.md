A custom theme developed for one of the UK's leading event promoters. Working closely with their head of ticketing I developed website the integrated their new ticketing system. It featured a hero component that displayed the most viewed event over the past hour. The theme was deployed to 9 different venues across the country. A focus was made to improve page load time, the previous site took 9+seconds to full load, the new one taking just under 2.
